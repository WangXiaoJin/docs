## 模板引擎

### [handlebars.java](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java)

Logic-less and semantic Mustache templates with Java


### [MVEL](http://mvel.documentnode.com/)

MVEL has largely been inspired by Java syntax, but has some fundamental differences aimed at making it more efficient
as an expression language, such as operators that directly support collection, array and string matching, as well
as regular expressions. MVEL is used to evaluate expressions written using Java syntax.

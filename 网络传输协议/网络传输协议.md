## RSocket

RSocket is an application protocol providing [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) semantics over an asynchronous, binary boundary.

It enables the following symmetric interaction models via async message passing over a single connection:

* request/response (stream of 1)
* request/stream (finite/infinite stream of many)
* fire-and-forget (no response)
* channel (bi-directional streams)

It also supports connection resumption to allow resuming long-lived streams across different transport connections. 
This is particularly useful for mobile<->server communication when network connections drop, switch, and reconnect frequently.

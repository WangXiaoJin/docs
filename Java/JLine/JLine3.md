# JLine3

## 简介

JLine is a Java library for handling console input. It is similar in functionality to
[BSD editline](http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/) and [GNU readline](http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/)
but with additional features that bring it in par with
[ZSH line editor](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html). People familiar with
the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells (such as bash and tcsh) will find most of the
command editing features of JLine to be familiar.
